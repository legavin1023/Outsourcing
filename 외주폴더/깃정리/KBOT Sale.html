                <dd>We strongly believe that real value of KBOT comes from its usage. To maintain KBOT tokenomics alive and healthy, liquidity and utility should be derived from the real world — for our case, from the Platform users. We have initiated ICO to grow the KBOT community and to incentivize market making activity; thus, increasing the real demand for KBOT. Those who have participated in KBOT ICO are either strategic partners or algorithmic traders, mostly with large digital asset to be managed.</dd>
                <dd>To relieve KBOT oversupply and price manipulation, Korbot LABS stores 50% of KBOT supply using a cryptographically secured escrow account. Also, the reserved amount will be systematically vested to the market in accordance with achievements in product development, operation and KBOT market performance. Every change in circulating KBOT will be monitored by us, investors, and community for 24/7. Most importantly, KBOT tokenomics strictly follow mathematically and economically engineered law and standards.</dd>

                <dd>KBOT’s vesting process has no difference from the burning process. We will make sure the vesting do not disrupt KBOT’s market performance both in short and long term.
